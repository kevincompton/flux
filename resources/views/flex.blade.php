            <h2>Flux Flex... There when you need it!</h2>
            <h2>Settlement Approved!</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Negotiating settlement terms is sometimes the easy part. Over the years, we’ve learned that clients who are going through financial hardship often default on the settlement and creditors are not obligated to renew their offers. Fortunately, Flux Flex is there when you need it, which is why we have a higher client success rate than the competition.</p>
            <h2>Extended Payment Terms</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>If your creditor agrees to settlement terms, but you can’t afford the required payments, Flux Flex can finance the settlement for you, reducing your monthly payment and extending the terms - This could be the difference between settling your account or being sued by your creditor for non-payment.</p>
            <h2>Rates Starting at 3.9%</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Flux Flex is amortized using a simple interest rate as low as 3.9% and never higher than 9.9%. Many clients will first attempt to seek outside financing from a bank or hard lender before joining our program, only to learn their rates are 20-30% or higher, due to their current credit circumstances. When compared to Flux Flex, taking on one loan to pay off another simply doesn’t make sense. Keep more money in your pocket, while eliminating your debts &amp; perfecting your credit!</p>
            <h2>No Penalties or Fees</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>We’ll never charge you a late fee or increase your interest rate and there is no prepayment penalty if you can complete your settlement sooner.</p>

          <h2>Flux Cash... Your Finances Reinvented</h2>
          <h2>Cash Out Your Debt</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>Every time you make a payment to settle your creditor accounts, you will earn up to 1.5% cash back! Your money will be deposited in $50 increments on a secured credit card, opened in your name, with monthly reporting to the credit agencies. Essentially, you are cashing out your old debt, while re-establishing your credit!</p>
          <h2>Your Money</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>Our clients always have 100% say with their finances. Your new secured credit card is yours to keep, even after you complete our program. You may wish to deposit more funds on the card to increase your credit limit, or you may withdrawal funds or close your account if you need the cash.</p>
          <h2>Convenience</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>Living without a credit card in this economy is difficult. Have you tried renting a car with a debit card? First, it will usually require a minimum deposit of $500 and your monies may remain on hold for up to a week after you return the car. This inconvenience can lead to bounced checks and bank fees. However, with your secured credit card, you cannot go negative because it’s your money and it acts like an actual credit card. Now that just makes sense!</p>
          <h2>Budget & Credit</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>Did you originally get yourself in debt because you were building up your credit and then got overextended? It happens, but with your secured credit card, it’s impossible. As you re-establish your credit, you’ll soon be approved for additional loans.</p>
          <h2>Flux Friend Referrals</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>Refer a friend to Flux Credit and you can both earn up to $250 in additional Flux Cash. When you both hit certain levels, Flux Cash will automatically be allocated to your account.</p>

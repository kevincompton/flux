            <h2>Is your Credit in Flux?</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Are you barely making your minimum payment(s)? Are the interest and late fees weighing you down? Does your credit card statement tell you that it will take 20+ years to pay off the account at more than double the current balance owed? Perhaps Flux Credit is right for you!</p>
            <h2>Open Upfront, Pricing!</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Through our proprietary technology-driven process, we beat the competition and eliminate your debt(s) at the lowest market rate. Clients can expect to save on average 45% of their balance due, which includes our 12% fixed rate!</p>
            <h2>How do we do it?</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Unlike the competition, who automatically draft payments from your checking account, while charging a service fee, we will never ask for your banking information. At Flux Credit, we empower our clients to save on their own and control their finances. Payments are only made once all parties agree on settlement terms. An agreement is then placed in writing and upon receipt of payment, your creditor account is closed for good!</p>
            <h2>1% Cash Back Rewards!</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>With Flux Prime, our clients earn 1% cashback on all settlement payments made. These funds are allocated towards a secured credit card, opened in your name, with monthly reporting to the credit agencies. Therefore, you are instantly restoring your credit as the bad credit falls off. We call this; Your Financesâ€¦ Reinvented!</p>
            <h2>Become Debt Free!</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Stop creditor harassment and avoid the long-term negative effects of bankruptcy. Your decision to start Flux Prime today could save you tens of thousands of dollars and a lifetime of stress. We developed this program with the goal of helping our clients become debt free 5-10 years sooner than by not settling the accounts.</p>

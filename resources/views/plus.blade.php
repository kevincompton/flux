            <h2>Flux Plus offers our clients a unique way to take advantage of all the valuable benefits of FLUX PRIME, plus:</h2>
            <h2>1.5 % Cash Back Rewards!</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>With Flux Plus, our clients earn 1.5% cash back on all settlement payments made. These funds are allocated to a secured credit card, opened in your name, with monthly reporting to the credit agencies. Therefore, you are instantly restoring your credit as the bad credit falls off. We call this; Your Finances… Reinvented</p>
            <h2>Attorney Representation</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>In some cases your creditor may file litigation to secure a judgment against you. However, clients enrolled in Flux Plus will have legal representation, that will file an answer in the local jurisdiction. Flux Plus clients will not be responsible for any additional attorney fees and our network of attorneys will take on the case to negotiate on behalf of our clients.</p>
            <h2>Tax Defense, Preparation &amp; Support</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Clients enrolled in Flux Plus may submit their tax forms to our CPA’s, who will prepare and sign off their tax return. There are many online sites that offer free tax service, however, if the IRS notices any red flags, you may be audited and on the hook. With Flux Plus, not only do we offer you full protection, but we maximize your return with our tax professionals. Some clients, especially business owners, may run into more complicated tax issues. With our Tax Defense strategy, we help our clients avoid penalties, interest, liens and levies. Wouldn’t it be nice to alleviate this stress and sleep well at night?</p>
            <h2>Credit Repair Service</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Your credit is constantly in flux. Although settling your accounts will satisfy your obligation, the creditor does not always report the updated status to the credit bureaus. Over time, your credit rating will begin to improve, but you may have several derogatory filings on your report that can be removed with appropriate action. Companies like Credit Karma offer a basic version of this service for free, but they do not cover all credit reporting agencies. There are services that charge consumers $99 a month or more to monitor their reports, however these services are limited to only notifying the credit reporting agencies without resolving the debt, whereas Flux Plus is an all-inclusive service in your best interest.</p>
